                        <p>Almost a decade ago, I started getting involved with the community and volunteer work. Whenever I started volunteering at Sinister Tombs, I got introduced to the haunt community, and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience. We're looking at moving towards a vendor role in the space, and I'm excited to get started with that soon!</p>

                            A few years ago, I had the opportunity to attend the Greater Knox Coding Academy, a programming boot camp offered through my local college. Even though we only ended up covering computer hardware and cybersecurity, I ended up enjoying the content enough to start going for a degree through the college. After taking the required programming logic course, I realized that I enjoyed software and wanted to make a career out of it.

                            I was on the robotics team in high school, and that what was initially sparked my interest in technology. I'm hoping to get into circuitry as a hobby soon.
